# Driver Drowsiness Detection Project
Driver drowsiness detection is a project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.

Logic of project
The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library. The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.


## Project Description
This project aims to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using computer vision techniques. It can be used to alert drivers who are drowsy while driving, thereby helping to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving.
